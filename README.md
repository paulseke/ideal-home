Udacity project 3: Finding ideal home location with OpenStreetMap - Python, DB-API, and SQL databases

We used data wrangling techniques, python , and SQL to obtain neat and cleaned data sets from 9 cities' osm files downloaded from the OpenStreetMap project. Then, we plotted latitude and longitudes of hospitals, schools,  kindergarten, restaurants... Ideal home location operational definition was an area where all the selected services and institutions were present.
